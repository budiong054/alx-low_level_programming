# ALX Low Level Programming

### Description
At [ALX SE](https://www.alxafrica.com/), we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a low level programming project. These projects are part of the ALX SE foundational curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of C Programming, variables, flow statements, loops, functions, pointers, recursion, static libraries, dynamic allocation of memory to more advanced topics.
